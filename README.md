  ## 🧾 Description
  A simple plugin to divide inventories into different game modes. Creative mode has its own inventory, and survival mode has its own.

  ## 💡 How it works?
  Whenever a game mode is changed, the player’s current inventory is saved, and after the mode change, the inventory of the mode to which the player switched is loaded.

  ## ⚠️ Warning
  No bugs or shortcomings were noticed during testing, but this does not mean that the plugin is completely stable.
