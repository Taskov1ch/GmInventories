## 🧾 Description
A simple plugin to divide inventories into different game modes. Creative mode has its own inventory, and survival mode has its own.

## 💡 How it works?
Whenever a game mode is changed, the player’s current inventory is saved, and after the mode change, the inventory of the mode to which the player switched is loaded.

## ⚠️ Warning
No bugs or shortcomings were noticed during testing, but this does not mean that the plugin is completely stable.
